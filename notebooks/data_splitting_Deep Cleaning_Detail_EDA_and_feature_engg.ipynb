    "In a professional banking workflow, the order of Feature Engineering versus Bivariate EDA is a bit of a \"chicken and egg\" situation, but there is a preferred path for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The industry-standard approach is to do Feature Engineering before Bivariate EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this order?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you create a feature like balance_per_campaign or age_groups first, you can include them in your Bivariate EDA and Heatmaps. This allows you to see if your newly created features actually have a stronger relationship with the target (y) than the raw data did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard: Create new columns that are derived from row-level logic (e.g., balance_per_campaign or age_groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why: These are based on business rules, not statistical distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Status: Correct. You did this before the split.\n"
